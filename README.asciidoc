walkmod-dead-code-cleaner-plugin
================================
Raquel Pau <raquelpau@gmail.com>

This is a walkmod plugin to remove unused declarations (imports, variables and private fields, methods and types) in Java source files. 
It applies the clean procedure in cascade. For example, if a unused method uses some types that are just used in this method, the imports 
related to these types are also removed.

== Example
Let's see an example. Take a look to this code. There is a private method called `hello` that is never referenced and 
also a variable in the `goodBye` method that also is never used. 

```java
package example;

import java.util.*;

public class Foo{
  private void hello(File file){
    ...
  }
  public void goodBye(){
    String s="bye";
    System.out.println("bye");
  }
}
```

What this plugins generates is the following modified code:
```java
package example;

public class Foo{
  public void goodBye(){
    System.out.println("bye");
  }
}
```

== Usage

. Add the https://github.com/rpau/walkmod-maven-plugin[walkmod-maven-plugin] into your `walkmod.xml` as a plugin. 
This plugin will interpret your classpath accoding your `pom.xml` and will compile your code.

. Add https://github.com/rpau/walkmod-dead-code-cleaner-plugin[walkmod-dead-code-cleaner-plugin] into your `walkmod.xml` as a plugin.

. Add the transformations `walkmod:commons:unused-declarations-cleaner` into your  `walkmod.xml` and 
set your refactoring configurations.

```XML
<!DOCTYPE walkmod PUBLIC "-//WALKMOD//DTD"  "http://www.walkmod.com/dtd/walkmod-1.0.dtd" >
<walkmod>
  <plugins>
    <plugin groupId="org.walkmod" artifactId="walkmod-maven-plugin" version="1.0" />
    <plugin groupId="org.walkmod" artifactId="walkmod-dead-code-cleaner-plugin" version="1.0" />
  </plugins>

  </conf-providers>
  <chain name="main-chain">	
    <transformation type="walkmod:commons:unused-declarations-cleaner"/>
  </chain>	
</walkmod>
```

You can apply walkmod-imports-cleaner-plugin via walkmod. 

  $ walkmod apply

Or, you can also check which would be the modified classes typing:
